WARNING:tensorflow:From new_model_train.py:46: calling argmax (from tensorflow.python.ops.math_ops) with dimension is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use the `axis` argument instead
WARNING:tensorflow:From new_model_train.py:220: softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:

Future major versions of TensorFlow will allow gradients to flow
into the labels input on backprop by default.
